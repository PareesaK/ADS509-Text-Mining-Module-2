    "\n",
    "A: <!-- Your answer here --> Assertions are used when the user checks assumptions in the code, like conditions that should always be true during development, and they also provide feedback to developers about potential issues. Exceptions are used when handling unexpected problems, like invalid inputs or errors that require the program to recover, ensuring the robustness of the application. Assertions help you catch issues early and to check pre-conditions, post-conditions of internal code.\n",

Stopwords are used frequently in almost every sentence and don't carry significant meaning, so their presence in the data could skew the frequency distribution of the words, overshadowing the more meaningful content and interpret the data into a wrong analysis.

The results mostly align with this belief, as Robyn's lyrics show a higher lexical diversity (0.142) compared to Cher's (0.103), and Robyn's Twitter data also has a higher diversity (0.292) than Cher's (0.252). However, the earlier assignment data, where both artists had a lexical diversity of 0.692, suggests that initially, the vocabulary range used by both artists was more balanced."
